#GBDSO Modules

This repository will include one or more schematics and PCBs based on the [GBDSO repository](https://github.com/pyroesp/GBDSO).  
In here I'll be making modules of the GBDSO schematic so that I can test them individually.  

A motherboard PCB will also be made so that all modules can be attached to each other and tested as a whole.  

Not sure yet how I'm going to set this up, but I'd like to keep everything related to the modules and motherboard in this repository.
